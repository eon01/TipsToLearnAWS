# Reverse Engineer Like a Hacker

Try creating an AWS EC2 machine to host Wordpress on a private subnet, create a public Nginx server, configure it to serve your Wordpress website, create another clone of your first machine, make Nginx load-balance the traffic to both servers ..

I know you can just start with ELB but there is nothing more helpful to learn a tool than reverse engineering it and understanding how it works !
