# Don’t be Ashamed to Ask

I know that a beginner could have some questions that could be considered as a n00bie questions. 

But any expert started as a n00b before becoming an expert !

N00b questions are the most seen in stackoverflow and other stackexchange forums even if they receive a negative number of votes.

In some forums, you may have answers like the "let me google that for you" answers but this doesn’t mean that you should not ask. 

Sure, finding the answer without any help is always better and helps more than asking the first question that comes to your mind. But don’t be ashamed to ask, if you need this.
