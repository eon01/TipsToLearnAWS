# Start Simple !

Just like any other new thing to learn in IT and development, we always start by the famous Hello World example. Your AWS Hello World will be creating a free tier EC2 machine on your default VPC, with a public IP, you can use the open Security Group and the default settings ! 

It will not be the most secured and optimised machine you’ll create but it’s okay to start.

After that start learning about:

- Which type of EC2 instance to use,
- The settings of your Security Group,
- How Elastic IP works,
- How tagging system works,
- How to create a subnet and how to use it,
- ..etc

You will have a lot of concepts to understand at the same time and you will find your path of learning.

Start simple then move on to more complicated topics !
