# Study Networking

AWS networking is simpler than on-premise networking systems, but having a good knowledge about networking in general is important:

- Create a subnet
- Make it public or private
- Learn about firewall concepts
- Ports, Ip addresses and CIDR
- ..etc

Don’t start by learning networking for AWS, learn general concepts about networking and you’ll find it intuitive once you’ll try AWS networking concepts.
