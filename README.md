I love helping people learn new things and this is what I’ve been doing during the last years ! It’s not just about projects but a passion.

At [Eralabs](http://eralabs.io), we’ve been coaching and helping companies learn and manage Cloud, DevOps technologies & Agile methodologies.

I am helping people learn Saltstack with [Saltstack For DevOps book](http://saltstackfordevops.com). I am helping people learn and master Docker and its ecosystem with my online course [Painless Docker](http://painlessdocker.com) ..etc

AWS is a technology I’ve been working with for some years now, I thought I could help people on their learning path to master this Cloud provider’s services & technologies. That's why I created [Practical AWS](http://practicalaws.com) guide and use cases.

If you are interested in discovering our new courses, register using this [form](https://eon01.typeform.com/to/MMPiyz), you’ll be invited to DevOpsLinks Community, our team chat and you’ll get updates about our future projects !
