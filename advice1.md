# Operating Systems are not Dead yet !

Even if you didn’t work with server administration and system/network engineering, you can do it ! You can learn AWS and this is what I want you to understand: Operating Systems are not dead yet !

They will, and gradually, but IMHO not for the next 5 or probably 10 years !

Don’t start by learning AWS, learn Linux ( or Windows server if you’re a Microsoft fan).

Some people say that a DevOps is a modern System Administrator which is somehow true. It's not the definition of DevOps but there is a part of the reality in this assertion.

The first thing you need to start learning is creating and managing an EC2 machine. We’re still in the virtualization and the OS layers !
